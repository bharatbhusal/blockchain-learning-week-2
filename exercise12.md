- **Healthcare**: The integration of smart contracts with public ledgers i.e blockchain, introduces unprecedented possibilities in healthcare. These contracts facilitate the posting and querying of public healthcare data, promoting transparency and accessibility.

Billing processes, patient medical records, and identity verifications can all be efficiently managed through smart contracts and blockchain, offering a secure and streamlined approach to healthcare management.
- **Real Estate**: Smart contracts bring a paradigm shift to the real estate sector by enabling the tokenization of properties. Through this technology, transactions can seamlessly occur on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. Rental agreements can be established with the assurance of trust, and agents gain the flexibility to operate from any location.
